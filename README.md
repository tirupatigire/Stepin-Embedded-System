 the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then he need to set the temperature 
accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater 
will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature.In our project we have 
used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and 
LCD diplay,etc.
The Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In 
European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that 
his equipment should work efficiently in that whether. In our project,
